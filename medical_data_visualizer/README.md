# Medical Data Visualization Project


## 1. Project Overview

This project analyzes cardiovascular disease risk factors using Python data visualization techniques. Built comprehensive visualizations to examine relationships between medical measurements, lifestyle factors, and cardiovascular health outcomes.

## 2. Problem Statement

Analyze medical examination data to identify patterns and correlations in cardiovascular disease risk factors. Create clear visualizations to understand the relationships between body measurements, blood indicators, lifestyle choices, and heart disease prevalence.


**Key Research Questions:**

* How do BMI and overweight status correlate with cardiovascular disease?
* What relationships exist between cholesterol, glucose levels, and heart health?
* How do lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, exercise) impact cardiovascular risk?
* What are the strongest predictors of cardiovascular disease?
